# Analysis of Seismological Signals on Active Volcanoes (Volcano Seismology)

This repository contains the Jupyter Notebooks that accompany the course **Analysis of Seismological Signals on Active Volcanoes** at the **Institute of Geosciences: General Geophysics**.

## Setup & Start

See the Jupyter [Setup Notebook](setup.ipynb) to begin the course.

**Note**: The course can be followed solely on GitHub. Only the **exercise_X** Notebooks require executing code and must therefore be run offline or use a Cloud Service such as https://colab.research.google.com to import and run the notebooks.

## Follow on Binder

[![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/EvaEibl/Volcanoseismology/2.0)

Here you can use and play with all notebooks.

## Google Colab Setup

If you don't want to setup Python locally you can follow these steps:

1. Go to https://colab.research.google.com
2. Sign-up/-in with a Google Account
3. Once signed in, press **CTRL + O**
   1. A new window will pop up
   2. Select GitHub from the menu on the top
   3. Enter **EvaEibl/Volcanoseismology** into the search field and press *Enter*
   4. Choose the notebook you want to work on :)

In case you chose to use Colab you can skip the [Setup Notebook](setup.ipynb).

**Note**: If you want to execute the code within the notebooks starting from Notebook 12+, make sure to create a new cell at the start of the notebook first and run `!pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn scipy obspy` first to install the necessary packages within Colab.
