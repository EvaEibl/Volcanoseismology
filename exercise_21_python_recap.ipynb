    "```\n",
    "99 bottles of beer on the wall, 99 bottles of beer.\n",
    "Take one down, pass it around, 98 bottles of beer on the wall.\n",

For example, with a shift of 3, A would be replaced by D, B would become E, and so on. The method is named after Julius Caesar, who used it to communicate with his generals.
