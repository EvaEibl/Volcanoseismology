    "## What is version control?\n",
    "* A system that keeps records of your changes\n",
    "* Allows for collaborative development\n",
    "* Allows you to know who made what changes and when\n",
    "* Allows comparing changes over time\n",
    "* **Allows you to revert any changes and go back to a previous state in case of mistakes**\n",
    "* **If combined with an online storage, it is a back-up of all your code**\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is Git?\n",
    "* Git is a command line tool to track and save changes of files within a directory\n",
    "* Git is a version control protocol that implements the features mentioned above\n",
    "* Git is free and can be used without the need of a cloud storage provider or user account somewhere\n",
    "* Note: There are also many graphical tools available\n",
    "\n",
    "## How do I install it?\n",
    "\n",
    "If you have followed the instructions in the   [Setup](setup.ipynb) you should have already setup your terminal in either Windows or Linux.\n",
    "\n",
    "* If you have chosen Linux, you may have to run `sudo apt install git-all` in a terminal.\n",

    "## What is GitHub?\n",
    "* GitHub is a cloud service offered by the inventors of Git\n",
    "* Local Code/Repositories can be uploaded to GitHub and shared with others\n",
    "* [GitHub.com](https://www.github.com) offers additional functionality on their webpage\n",
    "* You have to create a user on GitHub.com in order to upload repositories to GitHub. You DO NOT need an account to access and download public repositories!\n",
    "* GitHub.com is free of charge but more storage and other additional features require a paid subscription\n",
    "* Remember not to confuse Git with GitHub!\n",

    "* The way git keeps track of your code history\n",
    "* Essentially records what all your files look like at a given point in time\n",
    "* You decide when to take a snapshot, and of what files\n",
    "* All your old snapshots will stay around\n",
    "* You have the ability to go back to any snapshot at any time\n",
    "\n",
    "## Repository\n",
    "* Collection of all files and the history of those files\n",
    "  * All your commits\n",
    "* Stored on your local machine or on a remote server (e.g. GitHub, GitLab, ...)\n",
    "* The act of copying a repository from a remote server to your local machine is called **cloning**\n",
    "* Cloning from a remote server allows teams to work together\n",
    "* The process of downloading commits that don’t exist on your machine from a remote repository is called **pulling**\n",
    "* The process of uploading your local changes to the remote/cloud repository is called **pushing**\n",
    "* **Remote Repository** is stored online, e.g. on GitHub\n",

    "- Commit even if the version is still not working?\n",
    "  - Yes, but don't push it so that you don't break it for other people working on it.\n",

    "## Possible Problems When Pulling or Pushing\n",
    "\n",
    "- If you are working with more people is common that you will fail to push your commits or pull due to “merge conflicts\". \n",
    "- This happens when a file you modified has also been changed by someone else in the project after your last synchronization (Pull). \n",
    "- In some cases, Git can't decide which version to keep and will ask you to solve the conflict. \n",
    "- There are multiple ways to solve it:\n",
    "    - Keep your local version of the file\n",
    "    - Keep the remote version of the file\n",
